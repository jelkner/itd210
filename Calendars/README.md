# Calendar Explorations

Calendars are useful in so many places, but none more than in school. This
directory will contain experiments toward building a useful calendar to be
used on [our website](https://ict.gctaa.net/).


## Experiments

I'm going to start with three calendars:

* [Calendar-CSS only](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/xxYVrmK)
* [CSS-Only Calendar Layout &lsqb;CSS Grid&rsqb;](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/KKQzvdr)
* [year calendar](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/GRQZvRE)

and see if I can modify any of them to meet my needs.


## Notes

* [-prefix-free](https://projects.verou.me/prefixfree/) seems like a lovely
  resource to remove the need for CSS prefixes.
