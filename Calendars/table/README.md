# Responsive Calendar with a table

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/PNwaZe](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/PNwaZe).

Needs a browser with CSS Grid Layout enabled!

Playing with using semantic table mark-up rather than a list and CSS Grid to gridify the table, enabling the responsiveness.

Actually could simplify this by using Grid *only* for the responsive views and leaving it as table display when it fits.
