# Forms and JavaScript

In our Web Page Design class, we learn front-end web technologies HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript.  HTML forms are part of the curriculum, but they since
form data usually has to go to a back-end server, and we don't have that,
it is challenging to experiment with forms.

This directory will contain a few "experiments" to see if I can help address
this challenge for the benefit of my students.
