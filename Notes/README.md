# General Notes on Web Design and Development

At the end of the 2023-24 school year, I watched the following videos
recommended by my NVCC evaluator for end-of-year professional development:

* [Intro to Front-End Web Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C4dv8vuwEk)
* [Get Started in Web Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05r34Q9oM-8)
* [Intro to UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJLsSi7ehY)

All three videos contain lectures by Dan Rodney from
[noble desktop](https://www.nobledesktop.com/).  What follows are my summaries
of and reactions to each of these.


## Intro to Front-End Web Development

This video provides a nice high level overview of the content of our
ITD 110 and ITD 210 web page design courses. It begins with an introduction
to the *web development trifecta*,
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML),
[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS),
and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), briefly discussing
what each language is used for and providing short examples of each one.

I liked Dan's comments about both the increasing abstraction and increasing
complexity of each language, and how this relates to the fact that each
succeeding language acts upon the preceeding one(s). I tell students that
because each successive language is more "fun" than the proceeding one, we
have a nice motivation which helps us deal with the increasing complexity.

Dan next discusses
[front-end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) vs.
[back-end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#Server-side).
He talks about how JavaScript can now be used on both, and mentions how this
became possible when Google pulled their
[V8 JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine))
out of their [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) browser and
made it a separate application.

I appreciated Dan's description of the skills involved in both front-end and
back-end, and his willingness to state his opinion that people learning
web development should not "overreach" by claiming to be full-stack developers
when they really are not.

Next Dan discusses front-end JavaScript frameworks, including
[Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)),
[React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)),

I learned in this video about the 
[MERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)) solution stack.
Since our course is laying the foundation for using frameworks like this, it
is good to know what lies ahead for students who pursue their study further.

I also didn't know that
[React Native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_Native) existed as a
framework for writting web apps that can be compiled into native apps for
Android and iOS. Coming from the Python community, I have been aware of
[BeeWare](https://beeware.org/), which has the same goal, for a long time.

I was totally unaware of [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) (a.k.a "GreenSock"),
a JavaScript animation library that some of my students would *love*. I'll
ask one of them to check it out soon.

Dan then talks about [jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery), confirming
what I already knew, that while it played an important role in the development
of the web, modern JavaScript is making using it less and less necessary.

Next comes a brief discussion of
[WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress). I was already well aware
of this.

The lecture next discusses of code editors and revision control, specifically 
[Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code),
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and
[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub). I did not know that
VSCode was an
[Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)) based
application that could be launched on the GitHub website by simply pressing the
<code>.</code> key. Cool!

Dan then talks about the use of HTML and CSS for email. I learned several
things I did not know about how their use in email differs from current web
browser use due to the different ways they are rendered.

The lecture ends asking viewers to consider whether front-end or back-end
development might be right for them given what they learned in the video.

All-in-all I found it a useful lecture in which I learned several new things
and which I would happily recommend to my students to get an overview of
what we are learning in ITD 110 and 210.
