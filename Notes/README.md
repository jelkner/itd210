# General Notes on Web Design and Development

At the end of the 2023-24 school year, I watched the following videos
recommended by my NVCC evaluator for end-of-year professional development:

* [Intro to Front-End Web Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C4dv8vuwEk)
* [Get Started in Web Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05r34Q9oM-8)
* [Intro to UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJLsSi7ehY)

All three videos contain lectures by Dan Rodney from
[noble desktop](https://www.nobledesktop.com/).  What follows are my summaries
of and reactions to each of these.


## Intro to Front-End Web Development

This video provides a nice high level overview of the content of our
ITD 110 and ITD 210 web page design courses. It begins with an introduction
to the *web development trifecta*,
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML),
[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS),
and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), briefly discussing
what each language is used for and providing short examples of each one.

I liked Dan's comments about both the increasing abstraction and increasing
complexity of each language, and how this relates to the fact that each
succeeding language acts upon the preceeding one(s). I tell students that
because each successive language is more "fun" than the proceeding one, we
have a nice motivation which helps us deal with the increasing complexity.

Dan next discusses
[front-end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) vs.
[back-end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#Server-side).
He talks about how JavaScript can now be used on both, and mentions how this
became possible when Google pulled their
[V8 JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine))
out of their [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) browser and
made it a separate application.

I appreciated Dan's description of the skills involved in both front-end and
back-end, and his willingness to state his opinion that people learning
web development should not "overreach" by claiming to be full-stack developers
when they really are not.

Next Dan discusses front-end JavaScript frameworks, including
[Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)),
