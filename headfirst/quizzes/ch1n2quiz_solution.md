# Head First HTML and CSS: Chapters 1 and 2 Quiz

1. Define HTML element.

   > An *element* is an open tag + content + closing tag. It is a document
     component (*Thanks Henry!*).

     the requested resource and gives it to the browser. A web browser sends
     the request to the server (that the user makes by clicking a link), and
     then [renders](https://www.amsive.com/insights/creative/rendering-a-webpage-with-google-webmaster-tools/)

     teacher calls them **directories** (*Thanks Alex E.!*).
