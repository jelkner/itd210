# Using HeadFirst HTML5 Programming to Supplement CIW Curriculum 

I need to supplement the
[CIW Advanced HTML5 &amp; CSS3 Specialist](https://www.ciwcertified.com/ciw-certifications/web-and-mobile-design-series/advanced-html5-and-css3-specialist)
curriculum that I use in my web development class in one area in particular:
*JavaScript*. This topic is among the easiest to test (being a programming
language, it is trivial to generate questions about it), and the most
challenging to teach, so I find my students struggle particularly on the 
certification exam with JavaScript questions.

To address that, I plan to supplement the online CIW curriculum with
chapters from *HeadFirst HTML5 Programming* using the following mapping:

| CIW Lesson | HeadFirst HTML5 Programming Chapters |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 5: Introduction to JavaScript | Chapter 1 - Getting to know HTML5: Welcome to Webville and Chapter 2 - Introducting JavaScript and the DOM: A Little Code |
| Lesson 6: JavaScript Events, Functions and Methods | Chapter 3 - Events, handlers and all that jazz: A Little Interaction and Chapter 4 - JavaScript functions and objects: Serious JavaScript |
